Welcome to the code repository for our paper titled "Geostationary satellite observations can accurately estimate ecosystem carbon uptake and respiration at half-hourly time steps at eddy covariance sites." This research, led by Sadegh Ranjbar and a team from the University of Wisconsin â€“ Madison, explores the use of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite - R Series (GOES-R) data to model terrestrial carbon fluxes.

Polar-orbiting satellites have advanced our understanding of the carbon cycle, but their limitation in capturing sub-daily dynamics led us to investigate geostationary satellites. With the ability to provide 5-minute temporal resolution, GOES-R offers a unique opportunity for detailed carbon cycle analysis.

Researchers and practitioners interested in leveraging geostationary satellite data for sub-daily carbon cycle insights are encouraged to explore and contribute to this repository. For inquiries or collaboration opportunities, contact the corresponding author, Sadegh Ranjbar (sranjbar@wisc.edu).
